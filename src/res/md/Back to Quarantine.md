Earlier today, I read on ZhiHu that three more COVID cases are confirmed in Shanghai. I never imagined that this would cause the school to close down and restart the quarantine. Today is Thursday, and I will not go to school on next Monday.

I completely understand and support the local government's decision of quarantine. Apparently, it is easier to control a disease when only three cases appear. It would be to late to hope that a quarantine can root out the disease when hundreds of cases pop up. Continued economic activity is crucial to a nation's prosperity - even at the cost of a short period of sudden halt.

After the initial excitement of knowing I will no longer go to school for at least two weeks, I remembered the long quarantine that started almost exactly one year before and lasted for about 3 months. I am worried that I might still get a little depressed because of not seeing my friends.

Whenever I was on my way to school, I wished that I could stay at home. Now that I know that the quarantine is about to start I wish that I can go to school.

If this quarantine means the end of my year 12, high school, and 12 years at YKPao School, I am not ready to say goodbye. The news is just to sudden. The optimistic and rational part of me says that the COVID condition of 2021 in China is far better than that of 2020, suggesting that we will be back at school at no time.

Let us pray. Human are not programmed for quarantine.
