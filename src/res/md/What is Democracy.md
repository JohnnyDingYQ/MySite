What exactly is democracy? In the 20th century. George Orwell, in his essay _Politics and the English Language_, shares his take on democracy when discussing tbe use of meaningless words.

> In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of r√©gime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.

When I came across this section of the essay, I found it to be very interesting. Unlike Orwell's claim, today's democracy seems to have a mainstream or widely accepted definition - democracy means the **enfranchisement** of eligible adults.

Does that mean **enfranchisement** and **democracy** are inevitably related? Can enfranchisement be used as a benchmark for the degree of democracy?

Enfranchisement is a method to achieve democracy. Enfranchisement is the "mean", andd democracy is the "end". For sure there are more than one "mean" to achieve a "end". In other words, enfranchisement is not the only way to represent the will of the people and to be democratic.

In my opinion, it is a common pitfall to see enfranchisement and democracy as equivalent concepts. We must examine beyond enfranchisement when discussing democracy.
