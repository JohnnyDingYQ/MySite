title: "What is Democracy?"

When we talk about _Democracy_, we are usually talking about western democracy, in which all adults are enfranchised to vote.

However, the original definition of democracy is different. According to Wikipedia, democracy "is a form of government in which the people have the authority to choose their governing legislators". _A country is democratic whenever the will of its people is represented in the governance body._

Despite its recent challenges, western democracy (or enfranchisement of all adults) has been proven as one of the most efficient way to represent the will of the people and achieve democracy. Nevertheless, **un-enfranchisement** does not imply **the lack of democracy**. Enfranchisement (or voting) is not the only way represent the will of the people.

When terms are used, they usually lose its original meaning, carry new meanings, and can even become misleading or deceptive. It is important to not **passively accept and use concepts** but to **actively understand their implications and nuances**.
