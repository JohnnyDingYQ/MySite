Today is March 9, one day away from March 10 and my 18th birthday.

Frankly, I did not quite grasp the concept of adulthood. I though I was smart and told myself that adulthood simply means that "the earth has completed 18 revolutions around the sun since I was born".

Never mind, in society we do need to put special meanings to dates and numbers.

I guess this is a chance for me to look back, to reflect everything that I have done and has happened to me.

There might be to much to say, so I don't know where to start. I just wish myself the best of luck.
