Schools are factories - what a claim.

Before I get abstract and sensational, lets go literal. A school and a factory share many traits. Take a look at life before factories (or before the industrial revolution). Production was centered at home and family, and people work or rest according to the rhythm of the seasons and day and night. After the industrial revolution, workers concentrate in factories, have to follow rigorous schedules, and are constantly under the whim of the boss or the overseer. Students are similar to factory workers as students are concentrated in schools, also follow a accurate schedule, and are always supervised by teachers and dorm parents. In a literal sense, students share many traits with workers, and so does schools with factories.
