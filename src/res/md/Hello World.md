**Welcome to my site!**

I presume that not many people will be visiting this site or reading this post, and that's ok.

It seems that the age of personal sites has passed away (at least in China). Its funny to see that people tend to see personal sites as a mean to obtain fame and wealth, even when most of them are not "into" web design and development.

I create this site mostly for myself and do not anticipate great amount of traffic. This is more of a... show case of my skills? I only know that I need to at least make something "worthy of demonstration" using my poor (?) web development skills. In other words, I created this site for self approval.

I developed this site trying to utilize the most cutting-edge or trending technologies there are for web dev; I endeavored to maximize quality and structural integrity of the code base; and I made sure that I follow the best design/development pattern I know. I created the design of this site by myself under the aid of many friends. I would say that designing and brainstorming is one of the hardest part of this site since they deviate from the "problem and solution" paradigm of thinking.

Nevertheless, please navigate and enjoy :)
